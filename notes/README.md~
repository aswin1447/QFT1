# Approximate Lecture Notes

In this folder you can find PDFs of the lecture notes. I will mostly follow
them while lecturing, though there may be some departures based on
insightful questions. There are also some topics in the notes that we
will not be able to cover. I may also add material over time, and will
update the notes accordingly.

As of September 5, rough notes are available for the
first two parts of the course, on foundations and renormalization. The
notes for condensed matter applications are in development and will
appear when they are ready.
